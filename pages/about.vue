                    <p>Hi there!</p>
                    <h1>I'm Abubakri Sherif Opeyemi.</h1>
                    <p>I'm a Software developer based in Nigeria. I specialize in JavaScript and my main area of interest is Front-End Development. I love developing tools/sites/apps that solve real problems or help make someone's life easier. I like impactful work.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Skills</h2>
                    <p>My current skill set includes JavaScript, Vue, Nuxt, Firebase, SASS, Bootstrap, Vuetify, CSS, HTML etc. And that's excluding all the common (yet sometimes complex) build/workflow tools like Webpack, Babel etc.</p>
                    <p>
                    However, I believe in tool agnostic skills. Being in an industry that moves at the speed of time, it sometimes doesn't matter what frameworks/tools I'm familiar with. Because tools/frameworks are so fickle these days that they can become obsolete within months! What matters more is how fast can I learn and make myself comfortable with newer technology. I believe I'm a quick learner. I prioritize concepts over techniques. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simplicity, though overused (and sometimes misused) as a term, is something I really value. I like to build solutions that are simple yet interactive for the users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Besides coding, I'm also very passionate about Cyber Security and i really enjoy watching movies. I hope someday i'll be able to explore the field.
                    </p>
